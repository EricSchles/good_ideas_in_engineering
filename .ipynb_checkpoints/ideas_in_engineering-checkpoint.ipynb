    "* what is clean code?\n",
    "* The ideology of writing a function\n",
    "* Documentation - why and how\n",
    "* An introduction to test driven development\n",

    "## What is clean code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean code is code that is clear and easily readable.  It's code that doesn't just explain what's happening, it explains why it's happening.  The goal of code, especially in a language like Python is to be clear, and obvious.  We don't write Python because it's the fastest language in the world, but because it has the power to _optimize developer time_, which is a much more expensive resource than compute time.  That said, we should always try to performance tune our code, once all the major functionality has been written.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python in particular, lends itself to being clean by default, because there is one and preferably only one way one to do things.  This means, most code blocks should be easily identifiable, no matter what the context.  So you should always be able to know _what_ the code does, but you may not necessarily understand _why_ the code does it.  The general rules of programming are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* each line should do at most one simple thing\n",
    "* each function should be a single transformation or semantic action\n",
    "* each class should be a combination of transformations and data which are semantically related\n",
    "* ideally you should only have a few classes per file\n",
    "* where possible you should reuse code\n",
    "\n",
